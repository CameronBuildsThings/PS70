#### Weeks 8 CNC milling and 10 machine building and endefectors

  The lazercutter was down during the machine building week - so I volunteered to CNC the parts we needed, 
  thinking I could kill two birds with one stone.

  Using the surface sketch feature, I brought the parts from the 3D model into the shopbot programe and cut them, being mindful to keep the kerf on the outside of peices(in the discard material). 

  Some post-prossing was needed - the shopbot didn't cut all the way through some of the material, and the holes had to be widened slighly for ease of assembly.
