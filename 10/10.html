 I'd initially conceptualised this as a lamp/sculpture that would use two kinds of motion, there would be a hole in the base through whitch a sculpture of a bird would be flapping its wings and also the top part would be an animation wheel. In the end I ended up only really finishing the animation wheel, but I worked on them concurently so I've included documentation of that prosses as well.

 I used the pressfit box generator we talked about in class but made some modifications.

  Because the box was hexoganal instead of square the holes for the moving part needed to be hand drilled at an angle which I hadn't anticipated.

 the motor didn't catch well in the cardboard but that little peice of metal pinned it together and prevented that problem.

I tried a couple different ways to set up the arduino code for the servo, setting the position to spin to 30, 90 180 (and attempted 360 which was not possible) before I realised the servo I chose wasen't able to spin a full 360 degrees. I also tried to use the knob to controll the speed before realising the use-case that made more sense there was position because the servo could only rotate 180degrees.
